# multiclass-fish-image-classification
Multiclass Fish Image Classification using CNN and Transfer Learning (VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, EfficientNetB0) with Streamlit deployment.
# üêü Multiclass Fish Image Classification

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying fish images into multiple species using Deep Learning and Transfer Learning.  
We trained:
- A custom CNN from scratch
- Five pretrained models: **VGG16**, **ResNet50**, **MobileNetV2**, **InceptionV3**, and **EfficientNetB0**

The best-performing model (**MobileNetV2**) was deployed as a **Streamlit web application** for real-time predictions.

## üéØ Problem Statement
The goal is to develop a robust multiclass image classification model that can accurately predict the species of a fish from an image.  
The solution should be deployment-ready and provide confidence scores for predictions.

## üìä Skills Learned
- Deep Learning with TensorFlow/Keras
- Transfer Learning & Fine-tuning
- Data Preprocessing & Augmentation
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix)
- Visualization of training history
- Model Deployment with Streamlit

## üìÇ Dataset
- Images are organized in class-wise folders (one folder per fish species).
- Loaded using TensorFlow's `ImageDataGenerator`.
- Preprocessing:
  - Rescale to [0, 1]
  - Augment with rotation, zoom, and horizontal flip

*Note:* Dataset provided as part of the internship.
